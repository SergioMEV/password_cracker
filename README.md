# Naive Password Cracker
Me and my teammate, Aiden Jung, created this password cracker for a Grinnell College Computer Science competition where all the CS majors who were currently taking classes taught in C where tasked with cracking 300 hashed passwords as fast as possible. Our password_cracker actually ended up being the fastest! We cracked the 300 passwords in ~10 seconds, second place was ~12 seconds, and the mean time was around 90-100 seconds. We sped up our cracker by using multiple threads to crack multiple passwords at once and by using a hash map to traverse the list of candidate passwords.
